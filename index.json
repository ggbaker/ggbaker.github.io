As a reminder, some of the harder topics of the course are coming up, so make use of the resources available to you in order not to fall behind.\n25 October - Handout 6 uploaded.\n8 October - Handout 5 uploaded. The first homework has been graded and can be picked up during my office hours on Monday (11 AM - 12 PM and 2 - 3 PM).

The first Midterm will be on Thursday, 12 October. If you are looking to get a headstart on studying, the first place to look should be the past exams on Professor Kelly\u0026rsquo;s webpage, particularly those from past fall and spring semesters.\n25 September - Handout 3 uploaded. As a reminder the homework due date has been pushed to Tuesday, 3 October to allow you more time with the PPF material.\n20 September - Handout 2 has been uploaded. Last section was a lot to take in given that we were a bit ahead of the lecture. Although we will be following the lecture from here on, the pace will not slow down, so it is important to keep up. If anything is confusing, you should work practice problems and ask questions in office hours until you achieve clarity on the topic. Many ideas will build on earlier ones, so unresolved confusion will compound.\n10 September - I\u0026rsquo;ve uploaded Handout 1 and its solutions.
